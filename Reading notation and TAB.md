Musical notation is read and written using a _stave_, which is a combination of 5 lines and 4 spaces:

When we put notes on a stave, we can put them both on the lines and in the spaces, with each line and each space representing a different note:

The shape to the left of the stave that looks like a curly ‘g’ is known as a treble clef, which specifies which notes go on the lines and in the spaces. We put one of these at the beginning of every stave we use.

It is important to familiarise yourself with all the notes on the stave.

Luckily for us, there are some tried and tested ways to memorise them we can use.

### To remember the notes on the lines, we use the phrase:

Every Good Boy Deserves Football  
(E, G, B, D, F)

### To remember the notes in the spaces, we use the word:

FACE  
(F, A, C, E)

We can also have lines and spaces above and below the stave. A lot of guitar music will frequently use these notes, so it is important to become familiar with them. The stave below displays notes from low E string all the way up to a high B, the 19th fret of your top E string.

As the examples above show, musical notes are shown using letters from A to G, which are known as natural notes. However, we also have other notes in-between these letters, which are known as sharp and flat notes.

- When a note is sharp ( **♯** ), it is 1 note higher than the natural note (**♮**).
- When a note is flat ( ♭ ), it is 1 note lower than the natural note (♮).
- The natural sign (♮) returns the note to its original pitch. So if we move up 1 fret from B flat (B♭), we will return to B natural (B♮). We use the natural sign to show that a note that was formerly sharp or flat is now a natural note.

The following example shows how sharp and flat notes are written on a stave:

The above 2 staves, though written differently, would sound exactly the same. This is because some notes can be written in more than one way – for instance, the note between A and B could be called either A♯ or Bb, as it is both one note higher (sharp) than A, and one note lower (flat) than B. There are _no notes between B and C or E and F_.

Remember: _1 fret = 1 note!_
