A string is played ‘open’ when it is played without pressing down on any frets.

Each of the open strings is tuned to a note – from the thickest string to the thinnest string, they are tuned in the following order:

### E – A – D – G – B – e

Note that the first ‘E’ is uppercase, and the last ‘e’ is lowercase – when you refer to the low E string (the thickest string), you should always use an uppercase E, and when referring the the high e string (the thinnest string), you should always use a lowercase e. This is done simply to avoid confusing the two.

## Alternate Picking

This is when we pick in a continuous ‘down up, down up’ or ‘alternating’ fashion (no ups next to each other and no downs next to each other). Alternate picking is used to give an even attack to every note, and is much faster than just picking downward.

Down picking symbol

When playing this lesson’s course materials, you should try to use alternate picking. This can be particularly difficult when crossing from one string to the next, but with practice you’ll quickly be able to wrap your head around it.

You should also try to stop one string from sounding (also known as dampening) before you move on to the next – you can do this by placing your palm against the string you want to dampen as you begin to pick the next string. See this lesson’s video for a demonstration.
