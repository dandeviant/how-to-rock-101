A bar is a grouping of musical notes. Bars are separated using bar lines, which indicate the end of a bar.

Double bar lines are used to separate sections of music â€“ for instance, you might find a double bar line where the verse changes to the chorus.

Another type of double bar line is the final bar line, which indicates the end of a piece of music.
