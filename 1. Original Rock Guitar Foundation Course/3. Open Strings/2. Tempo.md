You will notice in the top left hand corner of this lesson’s course materials, there is a note followed by a number:

This is known as a **tempo marking**, which determines the speed of a piece of music by telling you how many note values will fit into 1 minute (known as BPM – beats per minute). This example means that there will be 60 crotchet beats per minute (or 1 crotchet beat per second) – 60BPM. As the number increases, the speed of the piece also increases – 120BPM would be twice as fast as 60BPM.

#### Use a metronome!

This is a device that produces regular ‘ticks’ or beats that will help to keep you in time. Make sure that you always practice with a metronome – there are plenty of metronome websites and apps that you can use. Set your metronome to match the specified tempo marking in each of the lesson’s course materials.

To use a metronome properly, you must first learn all the notes you have to play off by heart, then set the metronome to a speed where you can play your piece/exercise all the way to the end. If you find a particular speed easy, increase it slightly, but always make sure you can complete what you are playing to the end. Repeat this method, slowly building up speed to the specified tempo for all of the course materials.
