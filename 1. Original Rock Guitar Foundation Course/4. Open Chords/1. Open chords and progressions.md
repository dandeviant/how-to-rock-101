A _chord_ is when more than one note is played at a time. An _open chord_ means that the chord uses open strings.

_Major chords_ are constructed using the 1st, 3rd and 5th notes from the Major scale – for instance, an E Major chord is constructed from the notes E, G#, and B (the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the E Major scale).

##### E Major Triad

Note how a chord can repeat any notes in the formula, so the open E major chord in the 2nd bar contains 3 E’s, 2 B’s, and 1 G#.

_minor chords_ are constructed in a similar way to _Major chords_, using the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes from the minor scale – for instance, an E minor chord is constructed from the notes E, G, and B (the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of the E minor scale respectively).

##### E Minor Triad

As you can see, the only difference between a Major chord and a minor chord is the 3rd note – the 3rd note of the Major chord is a semitone higher than that of the minor chord.

Similar to the scale types, Major chords tend to have a happy sound and minor chords have a sadder sound.

Once an accidental (sharp or flat) has been introduced once in a bar, it does not have to be introduced again – it is assumed that that note will be sharp/flat until the end of the bar, unless specified otherwise by a natural sign.

In this above example, G♮ is highlighted in pink, and G# is highlighted in orange. Note how the accidentals affect the proceeding notes in a bar.
