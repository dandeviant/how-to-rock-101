Tablature (TAB) is another form of musical notation popular among electric guitarists. TAB indicates the fingering of notes rather than specific individual pitches. TAB consists of 6 lines, representing the 6 strings on the guitar. The bottom line is the low E string.

Unlike notation, there are numbers on the TAB lines to tell you which string to play and which frets to use, rather than telling you specific pitches. TAB is read from left to right. The following example tells you to play the low E string 2 times, and then the A string 2 times, without pressing down on any frets.

Numbers are used to tell you which frets to press down. In the above example, a ‘0’ is used to indicate that the string is played open, meaning without pressing down on any frets.

The following example tells you to press down on the 3rd fret of the low E string and play 2 times, and then press down on the 2nd fret of the A string and play 2 times.

When numbers are placed vertically, it means that multiple strings are played simultaneously. The following example tells you to press down on the 3rd fret of the low E string and the 2nd fret of the A string (at the same time), and play both strings 4 times.

The Orange Rock Guitar Syllabus uses a combination of notation and TAB; when we combine these, we place them one on top of the other:

This means that we can see the notes and the rhythm using notation, and the exact fingering and position on the fretboard using TAB. Be aware that sometimes you might find music that only uses TAB, or that only uses notation.
