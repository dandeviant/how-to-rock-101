The image below clearly displays all the names for each note on the fretboard. Do not worry about learning every note immediately, you can use this image as a reference until you develop a better knowledge of the fretboard.

The E at the bottom of the illustration (far left) is the bottom E string (the thickest one), and the E at the top of the graphic (far left) is the top e string (the thinnest one). This image features sharp notes only â€“ try and convert them to flat notes (for example, F# is also Gb).
