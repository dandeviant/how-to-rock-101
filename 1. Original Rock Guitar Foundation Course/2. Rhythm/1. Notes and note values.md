Rhythm refers to the steady pulse we find in music, sometimes called a _beat_.

## Crotchet

You will often hear rhythms counted as repeats of 4 beats, “1-2-3-4”, almost like footsteps. Each of these beats can be represented by a note, known as a _crotchet_.

Crotchet = 1 beat.

So a ‘1-2-3-4’ rhythm would be written as 4 crotchets:

## Minim

A note that lasts 2 beats is known as a minim.

Minim = 2 beats.

Therefore, in a 4-beat rhythm, we would find only 2 minims, on the counts of ‘1’ and ‘3’.

With this information, we can deduce that a minim is double the length or _value_ of a crotchet, so we can fit 2 crotchets into 1 minim.

## Semibreve

A note that lasts 4 beats is known as a semibreve.

Semibreve = 4 beats.

In a 4-beat rhythm, we find only one semibreve on the count of ‘1’.

As before, we can deduce that a semibreve is double the length of a minim, and therefore equal to the length of 4 crotchets.

There are also notes smaller than a beat in length, which will be presented later in the course.

## Rests

A moment of silence in music is known as a _rest_. Each rest has a specific symbol that is used to indicate its length relative to the note values you’ve learnt. For instance, a 1-beat rest is the same length as a crotchet (so it is also known as a crotchet rest):

2-beat rest/minim rest

4-beat rest/semibreve rest

Similar to the note values, we can fit 2 crotchet rests into a minim rest, and a 2 minim rests into a semibreve rest.
