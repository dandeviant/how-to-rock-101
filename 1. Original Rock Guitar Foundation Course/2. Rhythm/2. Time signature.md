The number of beats in a bar is specified by what is called a _time signature_. All of the above examples use a 4/4 time signature:

The top number indicates how many beats each bar has (in this case, 4) and the bottom number indicates what beats they are. The 4 on the bottom refers to a crotchet because it is commonly equal to a quarter (1/4) of a bar’s full value, since 4/4 is the most common and natural sounding time signature.

NB There are other time signatures with different numbers of beats per bar and with different types of beat, which will appear later in the course.

The following example shows a combination of crotchets, minims, semibreves, and various rests. We can use any combination of notes and rests in one bar, as long as their sum is equal to 4 beats:

> There is no specified rhythm for TAB – the fret numbers are placed directly beneath the relative note values in the notation stave, which give the rhythm. Sometimes you may see TAB without any notation, or notation without an TAB. Remember, when dealing with just notation you aren’t told which strings to play or which frets to use, and when dealing with just TAB you aren’t told the rhythm or which notes you are playing. Though using TAB may seem easier, it gives you much less information – you could play an unfamiliar piece of music correctly with just notation, but with TAB you would be missing the rhythm – so make sure you don’t neglect learning notation.
